  <li>Share their music through the cloud</li>

  <div><b>License and Pricing</b></div>
  3-launchpad is licensed under GPL v3. In short it is absolutely free as well as the source code.   
  There is no business initiative inherently designed with the application our sole intent is to build technology "for the people".
  
  <div><b>Why is it free</b></div>
  If fire were to be patented and sold then food would be merely unaffordable. The first vitruvian principle is utility so we make technology for it to be useful.
